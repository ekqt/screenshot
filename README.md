## Description

Screenshot is an open-source tool that provides users with granular controls to frame their screenshots and build engaging content faster.

![Build engaging screenshots faster](https://usescreenshot.app/teasers/Slide-0.png)

## How does it work?

To use Screenshot, go to [usescreenshot.app](https://usescreenshot.app), (1.) click on the frame to paste your clipboard's image, and then (2.) adjust the settings as needed.

![Frame your screenshot using simple settings](https://usescreenshot.app/teasers/Slide-1.png)

We are actively working to improve and add more settings to Screenshot. Our goal is to provide a **simple but powerful set of controls** that can adjust to your needs.

## Installation

Screenshot is a web-application being built with React in TypeScript, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components heavily inspired by [ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

To install and run locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamhectorsosa/screenshot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's directory and install its dependencies

```bash
cd screenshot
npm instal
```

3. Start the development server, open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000

- Using NPM:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Using Turbo:

```bash
turbo run dev
```

> Note: If you encounter a `Failed to Contact turbod` warning, this can be bypassed by running the command without the daemon process by passing the `--no-daemon` flag. More on this issue here: [Turbo Issues](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/issues/2034)

```bash
turbo run dev --no-daemon
```
